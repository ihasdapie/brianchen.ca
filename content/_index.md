# Hi, I'm Brian
And I'm an [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) student at the University of Toronto, majoring in ECE.
While I'm not cramming for school I like to cook, play badminton, and convert bubble tea to spaghetti code. [^spaghet].
I also occasionally write posts on my [blog]({{<ref "/posts">}}), so feel free to check that out too :)

[^spaghet]: but hopefully it tastes good
