# Hi, I'm Brian

####  and I'm a student, software-engineer-in-training[^engineer], and pokemon go enthusiast

[^engineer]: I'm still in school, plus 'engineer' is a protected title in Canada. Two more years to go!

![me](profile-picture.jpg)

I'm an [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) student at the University of Toronto majoring in Computer Engineering.
Outside of school, I'm passionate about making [cool stuff]({{< ref "/posts/projects" >}}) like self-driving cars, while learning more about the world we live in.
When I'm not cramming for school, I enjoy cooking and playing badminton.

While you're here, why don't you check out my [about me]({{< ref "/about">}}) page, or read more about some [projects]({{< ref "/posts/projects" >}}) I've worked on?
Or, take a look at my [blog]({{<ref "/posts">}})?

- [Projects overview]({{< ref "/posts/projects" >}})
- [Notes]({{< ref "/tags/notes" >}}) [^notes]
- [Resume](resume.pdf)

[^notes]: These cover most of 2nd year EngSci courses as well as some of my own studying, tutorial notes for the courses I help teach, and I like to think that some of them are \\( \LaTeX \\)-ed up nicely.
