# Hi, I'm Brian



![me](profile-picture.jpg)

I'm an [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) student at the University of Toronto majoring in Computer Engineering. 
When I'm not cramming for school I like to cook, play badminton, and build [cool stuff]({{< ref "/posts/projects" >}}) like self-driving cars.
Or, in more general terms: I convert bubble tea to spaghetti code[^spaghet].
[^spaghet]: but hopefully it tastes good


While you're here, why don't you check out my [about me]({{< ref "/about">}}) page, or read more about some [projects]({{< ref "/posts/projects" >}}) I've worked on?
Or, take a look at my [blog]({{<ref "/posts">}})?


### Quick links
- [Browse by tags]({{< ref "/tags" >}})
- [Projects]({{< ref "/posts/projects" >}})
- [Notes]({{< ref "/tags/notes" >}}) [^notes]
- [Resume](resume.pdf)

[^notes]: These cover most of 2nd-3rd year EngSci courses as well as some of my own studying, tutorial notes for the courses I help teach, and I like to think that some of them are \\( \LaTeX \\)-ed up nicely.
