# Hi, I'm Brian
And I'm an [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) student at the University of Toronto majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Robotics.
While I'm not cramming for school I like to cook, play badminton, and sometimes build [cool stuff]({{< ref "/posts/projects" >}}) like self-driving cars.
Or, in more general terms: I convert bubble tea to spaghetti code[^spaghet].
I also occasionally write posts on my [blog]({{<ref "/posts">}}), so feel free to check that out too :)

[^spaghet]: but hopefully it tastes good

### Quick links
- [Browse by tags]({{< ref "/tags" >}})
- [Projects]({{< ref "/posts/projects" >}})
- [Notes]({{< ref "/tags/notes" >}}) [^notes]

[^notes]: I like to think that they're \\( \LaTeX \\)-ed up nicely and are of non-zero utility.
