![me](profile-picture.jpg)

... and let's put a face to the name as well

I'm a student at the University of Toronto Engineering Science program passionate about making cool stuff and learning more about the world we live in.
When I'm not cramming for school, I enjoy cooking and playing badminton.

While you're here, why don't you check out my [about me]({{< ref "/about">}}) page?

[^notes]: These cover most of 2nd year EngSci courses as well as some of my own studying, tutorial notes for the courses I help teach, and I like to think that some of them are \\( \LaTeX \\)-ed up nicely.
