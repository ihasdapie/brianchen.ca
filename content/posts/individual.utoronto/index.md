Turns out UofT students/faculty/etc can host a free personal site (`50mb` max) in [individual.utoronto.ca](http://individual.utoronto.ca/) through an until-now seemingly entirely undocumented process.


1. Claim it through UTORid management [here](https://www.utorid.utoronto.ca/cgi-bin/utorid/info.pl)
2. Connect to it through a `ftp` client. If you go back into the UTORid info page it will tell you what address to use for `ftp` which looks something like `ftp://yourutorid@individual.utoronto.ca` I just used `dolphin`'s built in support for network drives to upload the files
3. Upload files through ftp and enjoy!

I just made mine redirect back to here: [http://individual.utoronto.ca/chenbrian/](http://individual.utoronto.ca/chenbrian/). Might put something more interesting up later...
