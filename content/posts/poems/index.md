Making it a commitment for 2022 to [read some poems](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/poem-of-the-day).


## The Jackdaw
[source](https://allpoetry.com/The-Jackdaw)


**William Cowper**   

There is a bird who, by his coat  
And by the hoarseness of his note,  
Might be supposed a crow;  
A great frequenter of the church,  
Where, bishop-like, he finds a perch,  
And dormitory too.  

Above the steeple shines a plate,  
That turns and turns, to indicate  
From what point blows the weather.  
Look up -- your brains begin to swim,  
'Tis in the clouds -- that pleases him,  
He chooses it the rather.   

Fond of the speculative height,  
Thither he wings his airy flight,  
And thence securely sees  
The bustle and the rareeshow,  
That occupy mankind below,  
Secure and at his ease.  

You think, no doubt, he sits and muses  
On future broken bones and bruises,  
If he should chance to fall.  
No; not a single thought like that  
Employs his philosophic pate,  
Or troubles it at all.  

He sees that this great roundabout,  
The world, with all its motley rout,  
Church, army, physic, law,  
Its customs and its businesses,  
Is no concern at all of his,  
And says -- what says he? -- Caw.  

Thrice happy bird! I too have seen  
Much of the vanities of men;  
And, sick of having seen 'em,  
Would cheerfully these limbs resign  
For such a pair of wings as thine  
And such a head between 'em.  


> There's something about the cadence and imagery here that makes this one so enthralling.





## Echolalia

**Ian Williams**  


Once one gets what one wants  
one no longer wants it.  


One no longer wants what?

 

One no longer wants what  
one wanted.

 
--

 
A man and a woman want a woman and a man  
or a man and a woman depending  
on the man and the woman.  

 

--

 

Once one gets what one wants once  
one no longer wants it once  


then one no longer wants it at all.

 

--

 

Yes then no. Yes and no? No.  
Yes then no then yes and always  
after yes comes no. Never always  
yes, but always no. Always know  
after yes comes no.  


--

 
One wants what one wants  
not what one wanted.  
  


## Ozymandias
[source](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias)  

**Percy Shelley**  


I met a traveller from an antique land,  
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,  
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;  
And on the pedestal, these words appear:  
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;  
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!  
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare  
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”  


> Yes, this was also the title of the [legendary breaking bad episode](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2301451/?ref_=tt_eps_top).  
> But where are his works? Ozymandias -- is now but two broken legs in the desert which "stretch far away". 

## Love
**Tina Chang**  
[source](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57416/love-56d23aec87f79)

I am haunted by how much our mothers do not know.    
How a republic falls because of its backhanded deals,  
stairwell secrets. My mother does not know I am lying  
with a man who is darker than me, that we do not  
have names for how we truly treat our bodies.  
What we do with them. The other possesses me.  
Without him the perception of me fails to exist.  
My mother now is taking her sheers and cutting  
through live shrimp. When I was a child she peeled  
each flushed grape until only the pale fleshy bead  
remained. She placed them onto a plate in one shining  
mound, deseeded, in front of me. How I sucked and bled  
the fruit of all their juice, hypnotized in front of the buzz  
of television in each version of my childhood. I am  
her daughter. This is certain. I am lying down with a man  
who is darker than me and maybe this poem is my  
real republic, my face is my face, or is it stolen from  
my mother and hung over mine? If I were a dream  
you could say my countenance was a string of flickering lights  
made of teeth or an expression unraveling like a carpet  
into a narrow river of another life. Does truth matter  
when it's floating face up or face down?  
The answer to this makes all the difference.
