Making it a commitment for 2022 to [read some poems](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/poem-of-the-day).


## The Jackdaw
**William Cowper**   
[source](https://allpoetry.com/The-Jackdaw)


There is a bird who, by his coat  
And by the hoarseness of his note,  
Might be supposed a crow;  
A great frequenter of the church,  
Where, bishop-like, he finds a perch,  
And dormitory too.  

Above the steeple shines a plate,  
That turns and turns, to indicate  
From what point blows the weather.  
Look up -- your brains begin to swim,  
'Tis in the clouds -- that pleases him,  
He chooses it the rather.   

Fond of the speculative height,  
Thither he wings his airy flight,  
And thence securely sees  
The bustle and the rareeshow,  
That occupy mankind below,  
Secure and at his ease.  

You think, no doubt, he sits and muses  
On future broken bones and bruises,  
If he should chance to fall.  
No; not a single thought like that  
Employs his philosophic pate,  
Or troubles it at all.  

He sees that this great roundabout,  
The world, with all its motley rout,  
Church, army, physic, law,  
Its customs and its businesses,  
Is no concern at all of his,  
And says -- what says he? -- Caw.  

Thrice happy bird! I too have seen  
Much of the vanities of men;  
And, sick of having seen 'em,  
Would cheerfully these limbs resign  
For such a pair of wings as thine  
And such a head between 'em.  







## Echolalia

**Ian Williams**

Once one gets what one wants  
one no longer wants it.  


One no longer wants what?

 

One no longer wants what  
one wanted.

 
--

 
A man and a woman want a woman and a man  
or a man and a woman depending  
on the man and the woman.  

 

--

 

Once one gets what one wants once  
one no longer wants it once  


then one no longer wants it at all.

 

--

 

Yes then no. Yes and no? No.  
Yes then no then yes and always  
after yes comes no. Never always  
yes, but always no. Always know  
after yes comes no.  


--

 
One wants what one wants  
not what one wanted.
