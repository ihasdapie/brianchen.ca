My first text editor was the one used in my highschool intro to cs class, [geany](https://www.geany.org/) -- which is a wonderful lightweight development environment -- and is, in my opinion, an excellent first editor because of its' simple yet powerful interface, cross-platform compatibility, and support for most relevant languages.

But, at the time, my laptop was a 11.6" chromebook with 16GB of *storage* and kitted out with a CPU less capable than most budget modern phones.

However, I really loved that thing; I had stickerbombed it and put [galliumOS](https://galliumos.org/) on it (a hacky process involving removing the physical [hardware write protect screw](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/write_protection.md)) as to get a full Linux environment. 
Also, the battery life was great and the minimal resources lead me to value efficient code and programs -- as well as push me into *really* using the terminal.






And so, I read up on alternative text editors

## Why `neovim`?

The [grok vi](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118) post
explains it better than I ever could.
