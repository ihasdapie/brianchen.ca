Download `TensorRT` from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt-getting-started). 
You do have to make an 'Nvidia Developers Program' account to download the `TensorRT` package, which I have mixed feelings about.
However this is easily bypassed if you are OK with building it from [source](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT)
