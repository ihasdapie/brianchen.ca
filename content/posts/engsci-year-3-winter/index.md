I've come to realize that some courses lend themselves to Latex'd notes better than others.
The following pdf contains _complete_ (!) notes for:

- ECE353: Operating Systems
- CSC473: Advanced Algorithms
- ECE568: Computer security

Note that all of these were taken during class and as such are somewhat stream-of-consciousness and can contain errors. Error reporting welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/ihasdapie/EngSci_Notes/).
