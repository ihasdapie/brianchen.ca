This page will track some notes and TILs for [AoC2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), which I will be completing in `rust` -- a language I am still learning.

Solutions are hosted [here](https://github.com/ihasdapie/aoc2021).
If a day isn't very interesting, I won't post anything for that day.



## [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4)
[Solution](https://github.com/ihasdapie/aoc2021/tree/main/d4)

Bingo is fun -- makes for a good way to play with some object-oriented rust code.



## [Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6)
[Solution](https://github.com/ihasdapie/aoc2021/tree/main/d6)


So many lanternfish! The key to this puzzle is to represent the lanternfish as a histogram rather than creating a list of all the lanternfish. See [solution](https://github.com/ihasdapie/aoc2021/tree/main/d6).



## [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7)
[Solution](https://github.com/ihasdapie/aoc2021/tree/main/d7)
This was an interesting one. Find the problem [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7).

For part a) we can note that given a set of numbers \\(x_1, x_2, x_3 \dots x_n \\) the point \\(p\\) that minimizes the cost \\(C_a\\), \\( \sum^n_{i=1} |x_i - p| \\), is the median of the set.


For part b), however, the distance cost, \\(C_b\\) is the sum of the sequence of numbers up to the point \\(p\\), i.e. for a distance of \\(5\\) we have \\(C_{a,i}=1+2+3+4+5\\).
We can then note that we can apply Carl Gauss's [trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression) for finding the sum of of an arithmetic progression.

$$C_b = \sum^n_{i=1} \frac{(d_i)(d_i+1)}{2} = \sum^n_{i=1}\frac{(p-x_i)^2-|p-x_i|}{2} $$
Then, we may take the derivitive of the above equation, doing a classic Calculus 1/2 optimization problem, and find that we may minimize cost when \\(C_b' = 0\\).

$$ C_b' = \sum^n_{i=1} \frac{2(p-x_i) + sgn(x_i-p)}{2} = 0 $$
Where the [sign function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_function) is a function which extracts the sign of a number.


Then, solving for \\(p\\) gives us


$$ p = \frac{\sum^n_{i=1}x_i}{n} - \frac{\sum^n_{i=1}sgn(x_i-p)}{2n} $$

which is simply the mean of of the set, \\(\pm\frac{1}{2}\\).


Day 7 was pretty neat.


## [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8)
[Solution](https://github.com/ihasdapie/aoc2021/tree/main/d8)
Day 8 can be solved by inspection and treating it as a logic puzzle.


## [Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/9)
[Solution](https://github.com/ihasdapie/aoc2021/tree/main/d9)
Flood fill. Note an optimization since we are working with depths: 1


## [Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/10)
[Solution](https://github.com/ihasdapie/aoc2021/tree/main/d10)


Braces matching problem. This is a fairly common problem that can be solved recursively or with stacks, so I'll just link to a stackoverflow [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16874176/parenthesis-brackets-matching-using-stack-algorithm) that uses the same stack method that I used.

The key observation to make is that for part b the remaining open brackets in the stack for an unbalanced string are the ones that must be matched up for it to become balanced.
So to create the string we can just reverse the stack, substitute closing brackets for opening ones, and `collect` it into a string.
