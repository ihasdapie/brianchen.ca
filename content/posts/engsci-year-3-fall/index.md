This semester I'm trying to do it all in  \\( \LaTeX \\).
There should be an embedded pdf viewer below, but if it doesn't work[^1], you can download the pdf [here](notes.pdf).
These notes are pretty good for the first half of most courses, then I got rather preoccupied with catching the flu and PEY co-op applications. In any case it should be a reasonably decent resource. Notes are somewhat better for ECE352 and ECE358 but definitely has holes.

The following courses are covered (with varying degrees of completion). Bolded notes are more complete

- ECE349: Introduction to Energy Systems
- **ECE352: Computer Organization**
- ECE355: Signals Analysis and Communications
- **ECE358: Foundations of Computing**
- ECE360: Electronics
- MAT389: Complex Analysis
