This semester I'm trying to do it all in  \\( \LaTeX \\).
There should be an embedded pdf viewer below, but if it doesn't work[^1], you can download the pdf [here](notes.pdf).
These notes are pretty good for the first half of most courses, then I got rather preoccupied with catching the flu and PEY co-op applications. In any case it should be a reasonably decent resource. Notes are near-complete for ECE352 and ECE358.
