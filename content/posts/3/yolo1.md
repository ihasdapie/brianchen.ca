Having done prior work with image classification in projects such as [SSigVer](https://github.com/ihasdapie/SSigVer) 
and playing around [CNNs and the GTSRB dataset](https://github.com/ihasdapie/roadSignClassification), I figured that I would take it one step further and
incorporate object detection & tracking. Whereas an image classifer just, well, classifies an image, object detection programs allow for the classification and recognition of 
multiple objects within an image.

* Change up the presentation. Less about why you did it in the intro but more like "about it" first.


### Process
I don't like writing code that I don't understand. Sometimes this makes my progress slow, however, I like to think that it's worthwhile in the end.
I started off by reading. You can find the list below

### Reading materials

1. [YOLO Object Detection Tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-perform-object-detection-with-yolov3-in-keras/)
    * Going through an implementation tutorial helped me get a grasp of how all the parts are supposed to fit together. This one used a pre-trained model. 
    I'll look into training my own after I play with this one a bit.
2. [Original paper on YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf)
    * This paper proved unusually accessible and personable. It's always helpful to read the original source to help understand the problems that it solves and why it solves it well.
3. [R-CNN](https://medium.com/egen/region-proposal-network-rpn-backbone-of-faster-r-cnn-4a744a38d7f9)
    * Having dug through
4. [Selective Search](https://www.learnopencv.com/selective-search-for-object-detection-cpp-python/)
