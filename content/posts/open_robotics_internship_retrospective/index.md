I spent the past summer at [Open Robotics](openrobotics.org/), a non-profit organization that spawned [^spawn] and maintains [ROS, ROS2](https://www.ros.org/) (**R**obot **O**perating **S**ystem) and the [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/) simulator.
I worked as a software engineering intern working largely on the ROS2 ecosystem 





Figured you would want it in 3rd person.

Brian Chen is a 3rd year undergrad student at the University of Toronto studying Engineering Science with a major in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
At school he helps lead [aUToronto](https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/), UofT's self-driving car team where he tries his best to help a car figure out how to drive themselves in the scary real-life world of roads and intersections filled with pedestrians and inconsistent signage.
Outside of school and work you can find him playing badminton, cooking for his roommates, and spending time with his dog.

This past summer he worked on the VIPER team under the mentorship of Jacob Perron helping maintain the ROS2 and Gazebo systems on which their simulation, ground flight control, and autonomy systems are based.
Aside from maintenance tickets and small feature requests, the major project he worked on this summer was proposing, designing, and implementing [REP2012: Service Introspection](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/360), a feature that will _finally_ enable (after 10+ years) introspection of ROS2 services, i.e. `ros2 service echo` and `ros2 bag record --services`. 
This was a rather involved feature to implement, necessitating changes from the `rosidl` and `rmw` layers all the way to the client libraries, `rclcpp` and `rclpy`.
He hopes that the new service introspection features and associated tooling will benefit the ROS ecosystem by enabling users to easily integrate and develop ROS2 services and with their robots without having to roll their own methods to look at what a service is doing.


You also mentioned links to PRs, demos, etc.
