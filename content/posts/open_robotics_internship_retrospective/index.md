I spent summer 2022 interning at [Open Robotics](openrobotics.org/)[^acquire], a non-profit organization that spawned [^spawn] and maintains [ROS, ROS2](https://www.ros.org/) (**R**obot **O**perating **S**ystem) and the [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/) simulator.

[^acquire]: They've since been acquired by Intrinsic, an Alphabet company






Since writing up an retrospective is a lot more work than I'd like to put in right now, here's the output of `gh search prs --involves ihasdapie -L 100` in the relevant ros orgs, if that's of interest.
It's also pretty cool to see the [Iron Irwini Release Notes](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Releases/Release-Iron-Irwini.html) since I worked on a number of features there, most notably [service introspection](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Releases/Release-Iron-Irwini.html#service-introspection)
